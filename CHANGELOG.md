All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Centralized the Kolony brand identity (name, tagline, emoji, and contact info) inside `src/lib/constants.ts` and wired it into the marketing surfaces (homepage, HiveMind, Creator Studio, testimonials, and shared footer) so every visible touchpoint stays in sync.
- Documented the update in the StudioShare thread and refreshed the marketing copy to reflect the aligned brand voice.
