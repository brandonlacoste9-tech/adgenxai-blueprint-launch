# StudioShare Thread

## 2025-11-17
- Unified every front-of-house surface behind the new `BRAND_IDENTITY` constant so HiveMind, Creator Studio, the homepage hero, and the shared footer all echo the same Kolony name, tagline, emoji, and contact channel.
- Ran a copy pass on the testimonials and footer contact blocks to eliminate the lingering AdGenXAI mentions and highlight the refreshed Kolony positioning.
- Logged the change in `CHANGELOG.md` so downstream swarm members can quickly audit what shifted.
- Captured a refreshed homepage screenshot (artifact: `brand-refresh-home.png`) to keep the marketing kit current.
