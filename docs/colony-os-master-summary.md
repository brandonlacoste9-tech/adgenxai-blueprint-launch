# Colony OS — System Summary (Codex Briefing Mode)

**Unified, business-mode summary of all repos, systems, agents, workflows, and architecture spanning BeeHive, FoundryAI, AdGenAI/AdGenXAI, and Colony OS.**

---

## 1. Platform Overview

The ecosystem combines four primary strata:

- **Colony OS** – sovereign AI civilization operating system
- **BeeHive** – operational and orchestration layer
- **FoundryAI / AdGenXAI** – cognitive and creative engines
- **Codex System** – governance, automation, and workflow lattice

Each layer contributes agents, rituals, pipelines, telemetry, CI/CD governance, creative engines, and safety systems that interlock as a single operating fabric.
