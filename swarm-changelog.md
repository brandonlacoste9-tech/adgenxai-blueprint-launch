# Swarm Changelog

## 2024-12-06
- Routed the chat widget's scroll effect through the Radix viewport ref so each reply stays pinned once streamed in.
- Documented the ScrollArea viewportRef prop so other swarm tools can latch onto the real scrollable node.
- Added smooth scrolling that respects reduced motion preferences so the viewport snap feels polished but accessible.

## StudioShare Thread
- Posted update: "Chatbot viewport ref now scroll-locks assistant replies; ScrollArea exposes viewportRef for reuse."
